        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When I moved from Lebanon to Florida spring of 1999, I brought with me my love for 
            cooking and search for new recipes. The famous key lime pie was new to me. It was a 
            friend's best dessert, and he used to buy it from Costco everytime we go for shopping.
            I tasted the pie at several places, but they were missing that wow flavor. I kept playing
            with the recipe, and the right flavor is found. I live now in North Bay, Ontario, and we
            only get the Key Limes twice a year, so sometimes I substitute with fresh lime juice. I 
            hope you all enjoy!!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup toasted slivered almonds</li>
            <li>1 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>4 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1(14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup key lime juice</li>
            <li>3/4 cup cold heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Pulse the almonds in a food processor until finely ground. Combine the almonds with
                the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and salt. Pour in the melted butter and mix until 
                evenly moistened. Press into 9-inch pie plate.</li>
            <li>Bake the crust in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 13 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the crust is baking, beat the egg yolks in a bowl with the condensed milk, 
                cream, and lime zest. Whisk in the lime juice a little at a time to thicken the custard.
                Pour the custard into the pie crust and return to the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for 15 minutes to help the custard begin to set. Cool to room temperature
                on a wire rack before covering loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerating overnight.</li>
        </ol>
