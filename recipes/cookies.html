            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>

            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F(175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with 
            parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar 
            until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy.
            Mix in the sifted flour ingredients until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips 
            by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared
            cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are slightly
            toasted. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire rackas 
            to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
